	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Chocolate cupcakes are the ultimate party food. These are super moist and bursting with rich, chocolaty flavor â€” and they're so easy to make. Frost these delicious chocolate cupcakes with buttercream or cream cheese frosting, or try royal icing or even whipped cream.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>100g plain flour</li>
		<li>20g cocoa powder</li>
		<li>140g caster sugar</li>
		<li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li>
		<li>40g unsalted butter (at room temperature)</li>
		<li>120ml whole milk</li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
		<li>Buttercream</li>
		<li>Chocolate vermicelli (optional)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, a pinch of salt and the butter in a free-standing electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a handheld electric whisk). Beat on a slow speed until you get a sandy consistency and everything is combined.</li>
		<li>Whisk the milk, egg and vanilla extract together in a jug, then slowly pour about half into the flour mixture. Beat to combine and turn the mixer up to high speed, scraping any mixture from the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pour in the remaining liquid and continue mixing for a couple more minutes until the mixture is smooth. Do not overmix.</li>
		<li>poon the mixture into the paper cases until approximately two-thirds full. Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the sponge bounces back when touched and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
		<li>Leave the cupcakes to cool slightly in the tray before turning out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make chocolate buttercream or plain buttercream and spread it over the cakes with a palette knife, or use a piping bag. Scatter over chocolate vermicelli, if you like.</li>
	</ol>
